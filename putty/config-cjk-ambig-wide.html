<h1><a name="S4.10.2"></a>4.10.2 &#8216;Treat <a name="i0"></a>CJK ambiguous characters as wide&#8217;</h1>
<p>
There are <a name="i1"></a>some Unicode characters whose <a name="i2"></a>width is not well-defined. In most contexts, such characters should be treated as single-width for the purposes of <a name="i3"></a>wrapping and so on; however, in some CJK contexts, they are better treated as double-width for historical reasons, and some server-side applications may expect them to be displayed as such. Setting this option will cause PuTTY to take the double-width interpretation.
</p>
<p>
If you use legacy CJK applications, and you find your lines are wrapping in the wrong places, or you are having other display problems, you might want to play with this setting.
</p>
<p>
This option only has any effect in <a name="i4"></a>UTF-8 mode (see <a href="config-charset.html#S4.10.1">section 4.10.1</a>).
