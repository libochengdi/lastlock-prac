<h1><a name="S4.11.4"></a>4.11.4 Assigning copy and paste actions to clipboards</h1>
<p>
Here you can configure which clipboard(s) are written or read by PuTTY's various copy and paste actions.
</p>
<p>
Most platforms, including Windows, have a single system clipboard. On these platforms, PuTTY provides a second clipboard-like facility by permitting you to paste the text you last selected in <em>this window</em>, whether or not it is currently also in the system clipboard. This is not enabled by default.
</p>
<p>
The X Window System (which underlies most Unix graphical interfaces) provides multiple clipboards (or &#8216;<a name="i0"></a>selections&#8217;), and many applications support more than one of them by a different user interface mechanism. When PuTTY itself is running on Unix, it has more configurability relating to these selections.
</p>
<p>
The two most commonly used selections are called &#8216;<a name="i1"></a><code>PRIMARY</code>&#8217; and &#8216;<a name="i2"></a><code>CLIPBOARD</code>&#8217;; in applications supporting both, the usual behaviour is that <code>PRIMARY</code> is used by mouse-only actions (selecting text automatically copies it to <code>PRIMARY</code>, and <a name="i3"></a>middle-clicking pastes from <code>PRIMARY</code>), whereas <code>CLIPBOARD</code> is used by explicit Copy and Paste menu items or keypresses such as <a name="i4"></a>Ctrl-C and <a name="i5"></a>Ctrl-V.
