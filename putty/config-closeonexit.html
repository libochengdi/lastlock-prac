<p>
Finally in the Session panel, there is an option labelled &#8216;Close window on exit&#8217;. This controls whether the PuTTY <a name="i1"></a>terminal window disappears as soon as the session inside it terminates. If you are likely to want to copy and paste text out of the session after it has terminated, or restart the session, you should arrange for this option to be off.
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Close window on exit&#8217; has three settings. &#8216;Always&#8217; means always close the window on exit; &#8216;Never&#8217; means never close on exit (always leave the window open, but <a name="i2"></a>inactive). The third setting, and the default one, is &#8216;Only on clean exit&#8217;. In this mode, a session which terminates normally will cause its window to close, but one which is aborted unexpectedly by network trouble or a confusing message from the server will leave the window up.
