<h1><a name="S4.4.9"></a>4.4.9 &#8216;Control-Alt is different from <a name="i0"></a>AltGr&#8217;</h1>
<p>
Some old keyboards do not have an AltGr key, which can make it difficult to type some characters. PuTTY can be configured to treat the key combination Ctrl + Left Alt the same way as the AltGr key.
</p>
<p>
By default, this checkbox is checked, and the key combination Ctrl + Left Alt does something completely different. PuTTY's usual handling of the left Alt key is to prefix the Escape (Control-<code>[</code>) character to whatever character sequence the rest of the keypress would generate. For example, Alt-A generates Escape followed by <code>a</code>. So Alt-Ctrl-A would generate Escape, followed by Control-A.
</p>
<p>
If you uncheck this box, Ctrl-Alt will become a synonym for AltGr, so you can use it to type extra graphic characters if your keyboard has any.
</p>
<p>
(However, Ctrl-Alt will never act as a Compose key, regardless of the setting of &#8216;AltGr acts as Compose key&#8217; described in <a href="config-compose.html#S4.4.8">section 4.4.8</a>.)
