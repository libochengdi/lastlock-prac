<h1><a name="S4.15.5"></a>4.15.5 Setting <a name="i0"></a>environment variables on the server</h1>
<p>
The Telnet protocol provides a means for the client to pass environment variables to the server. Many Telnet servers have stopped supporting this feature due to security flaws, but PuTTY still supports it for the benefit of any servers which have found other ways around the security problems than just disabling the whole mechanism.
</p>
<p>
Version 2 of the SSH protocol also provides a similar mechanism, which is easier to implement without security flaws. Newer <a name="i1"></a>SSH-2 servers are more likely to support it than older ones.
</p>
<p>
This configuration data is not used in the SSH-1, rlogin or raw protocols.
</p>
<p>
To add an environment variable to the list transmitted down the connection, you enter the variable name in the &#8216;Variable&#8217; box, enter its value in the &#8216;Value&#8217; box, and press the &#8216;Add&#8217; button. To remove one from the list, select it in the list box and press &#8216;Remove&#8217;.
