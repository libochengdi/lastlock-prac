<h1><a name="S4.3.5"></a>4.3.5 &#8216;Use <a name="i0"></a>background colour to erase screen&#8217;</h1>
<p>
Not all terminals agree on what colour to turn the screen when the server sends a &#8216;<a name="i1"></a>clear screen&#8217; sequence. Some terminals believe the screen should always be cleared to the <em>default</em> background colour. Others believe the screen should be cleared to whatever the server has selected as a background colour.
</p>
<p>
There exist applications that expect both kinds of behaviour. Therefore, PuTTY can be configured to do either.
</p>
<p>
With this option disabled, screen clearing is always done in the default background colour. With this option enabled, it is done in the <em>current</em> background colour.
</p>
<p>
Background-colour erase can be turned on and off by <a name="i2"></a>control sequences sent by the server. This configuration option controls the <em>default</em> state, which will be restored when you reset the terminal (see <a href="reset-terminal.html#S3.1.3.6">section 3.1.3.6</a>). However, if you modify this option in mid-session using &#8216;Change Settings&#8217;, it will take effect immediately.
