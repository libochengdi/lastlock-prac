<h1><a name="S4.6.11"></a>4.6.11 Disabling <a name="i0"></a>bidirectional text display</h1>
<p>
PuTTY supports bidirectional text display, which means that if your server sends text written in a language which is usually displayed from right to left (such as <a name="i1"></a>Arabic or <a name="i2"></a>Hebrew) then PuTTY will automatically flip it round so that it is displayed in the right direction on the screen.
</p>
<p>
If you are using full-screen software which was not expecting this to happen (especially if you are not an Arabic speaker and you unexpectedly find yourself dealing with Arabic text files in applications which are not Arabic-aware), you might find that the <a name="i3"></a>display becomes corrupted. By ticking this box, you can disable bidirectional text display, so that PuTTY displays text from left to right in all situations.
</p>
<p>
You may also find you need to disable Arabic text shaping; see <a href="config-features-shaping.html#S4.6.10">section 4.6.10</a>.
