<h1><a name="S4.6.9"></a>4.6.9 Disabling remote <a name="i0"></a>character set configuration</h1>
<p>
PuTTY has the ability to change its character set configuration in response to commands from the server. Some programs send these commands unexpectedly or inconveniently. In particular, <a name="i1"></a>BitchX (an IRC client) seems to have a habit of reconfiguring the character set to something other than the user intended.
</p>
<p>
If you find that accented characters are not showing up the way you expect them to, particularly if you're running BitchX, you could try disabling the remote character set configuration commands.
