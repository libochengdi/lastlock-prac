<h1><a name="S4.6.10"></a>4.6.10 Disabling <a name="i0"></a>Arabic text shaping</h1>
<p>
PuTTY supports shaping of Arabic text, which means that if your server sends text written in the basic <a name="i1"></a>Unicode Arabic alphabet then it will convert it to the correct display forms before printing it on the screen.
</p>
<p>
If you are using full-screen software which was not expecting this to happen (especially if you are not an Arabic speaker and you unexpectedly find yourself dealing with Arabic text files in applications which are not Arabic-aware), you might find that the <a name="i2"></a>display becomes corrupted. By ticking this box, you can disable Arabic text shaping so that PuTTY displays precisely the characters it is told to display.
</p>
<p>
You may also find you need to disable bidirectional text display; see <a href="config-features-bidi.html#S4.6.11">section 4.6.11</a>.
