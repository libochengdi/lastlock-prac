<h1><a name="S4.10.4"></a>4.10.4 Controlling display of <a name="i0"></a>line-drawing characters</h1>
<p>
VT100-series terminals allow the server to send <a name="i1"></a>control sequences that shift temporarily into a separate character set for drawing simple lines and boxes. However, there are a variety of ways in which PuTTY can attempt to find appropriate characters, and the right one to use depends on the locally configured <a name="i2"></a>font. In general you should probably try lots of options until you find one that your particular font supports.
</p>
<ul><li>
&#8216;Use Unicode line drawing code points&#8217; tries to use the box characters that are present in <a name="i3"></a>Unicode. For good Unicode-supporting fonts this is probably the most reliable and functional option.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;Poor man's line drawing&#8217; assumes that the font <em>cannot</em> generate the line and box characters at all, so it will use the <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> and <code>|</code> characters to draw approximations to boxes. You should use this option if none of the other options works.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;Font has XWindows encoding&#8217; is for use with fonts that have a special encoding, where the lowest 32 character positions (below the ASCII printable range) contain the line-drawing characters. This is unlikely to be the case with any standard Windows font; it will probably only apply to custom-built fonts or fonts that have been automatically converted from the X Window System.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;Use font in both ANSI and OEM modes&#8217; tries to use the same font in two different character sets, to obtain a wider range of characters. This doesn't always work; some fonts claim to be a different size depending on which character set you try to use.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;Use font in OEM mode only&#8217; is more reliable than that, but can miss out other characters from the main character set.
</li>
</ul>
