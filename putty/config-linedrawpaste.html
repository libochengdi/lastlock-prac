<h1><a name="S4.10.5"></a>4.10.5 Controlling <a name="i0"></a>copy and paste of line drawing characters</h1>
<p>
By default, when you copy and paste a piece of the PuTTY screen that contains VT100 line and box drawing characters, PuTTY will paste them in the form they appear on the screen: either <a name="i1"></a>Unicode line drawing code points, or the &#8216;poor man's&#8217; line-drawing characters <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> and <code>|</code>. The checkbox &#8216;Copy and paste VT100 line drawing chars as lqqqk&#8217; disables this feature, so line-drawing characters will be pasted as the <a name="i2"></a>ASCII characters that were printed to produce them. This will typically mean they come out mostly as <code>q</code> and <code>x</code>, with a scattering of <code>jklmntuvw</code> at the corners. This might be useful if you were trying to recreate the same box layout in another program, for example.
</p>
<p>
Note that this option only applies to line-drawing characters which <em>were</em> printed by using the VT100 mechanism. Line-drawing characters that were received as Unicode code points will paste as Unicode always.
