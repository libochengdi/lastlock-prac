<h1><a name="S4.11.1"></a>4.11.1 Changing the actions of the mouse buttons</h1>
<p>
PuTTY's copy and paste mechanism is by default modelled on the Unix <a name="i0"></a><code>xterm</code> application. The X Window System uses a three-button mouse, and the convention in that system is that the <a name="i1"></a>left button <a name="i2"></a>selects, the <a name="i3"></a>right button extends an existing selection, and the <a name="i4"></a>middle button pastes.
</p>
<p>
Windows often only has two mouse buttons, so when run on Windows, PuTTY is configurable. In PuTTY's default configuration (&#8216;Compromise&#8217;), the <em>right</em> button pastes, and the <em>middle</em> button (if you have one) <a name="i5"></a>extends a selection.
</p>
<p>
If you have a <a name="i6"></a>three-button mouse and you are already used to the <code>xterm</code> arrangement, you can select it using the &#8216;Action of mouse buttons&#8217; control.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, with the &#8216;Windows&#8217; option selected, the middle button extends, and the right button brings up a <a name="i7"></a>context menu (on which one of the options is &#8216;Paste&#8217;). (This context menu is always available by holding down Ctrl and right-clicking, regardless of the setting of this option.)
</p>
<p>
(When PuTTY itself is running on Unix, it follows the X Window System convention.)
