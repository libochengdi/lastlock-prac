<h1><a name="S4.29.1"></a>4.29.1 &#8216;Handling of OLD_ENVIRON ambiguity&#8217;</h1>
<p>
The original Telnet mechanism for passing <a name="i0"></a>environment variables was badly specified. At the time the standard (RFC 1408) was written, BSD telnet implementations were already supporting the feature, and the intention of the standard was to describe the behaviour the BSD implementations were already using.
</p>
<p>
Sadly there was a typing error in the standard when it was issued, and two vital function codes were specified the wrong way round. BSD implementations did not change, and the standard was not corrected. Therefore, it's possible you might find either <a name="i1"></a>BSD or <a name="i2"></a>RFC-compliant implementations out there. This switch allows you to choose which one PuTTY claims to be.
</p>
<p>
The problem was solved by issuing a second standard, defining a new Telnet mechanism called <a name="i3"></a><code>NEW_ENVIRON</code>, which behaved exactly like the original <a name="i4"></a><code>OLD_ENVIRON</code> but was not encumbered by existing implementations. Most Telnet servers now support this, and it's unambiguous. This feature should only be needed if you have trouble passing environment variables to quite an old server.
