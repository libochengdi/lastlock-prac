<p>
Often the proxy interaction has its own diagnostic output; this is particularly the case for local proxy commands.
</p>
<p>
The setting &#8216;Print proxy diagnostics in the terminal window&#8217; lets you control how much of the proxy's diagnostics are printed to the main terminal window, along with output from your main session.
</p>
<p>
By default (&#8216;No&#8217;), proxy diagnostics are only sent to the Event Log; with &#8216;Yes&#8217; they are also printed to the terminal, where they may get mixed up with your main session. &#8216;Only until session starts&#8217; is a compromise; proxy messages will go to the terminal window until the main session is deemed to have started (in a protocol-dependent way), which is when they're most likely to be interesting; any further proxy-related messages during the session will only go to the Event Log.
