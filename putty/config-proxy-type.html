<h1><a name="S4.16.1"></a>4.16.1 Setting the proxy type</h1>
<p>
The &#8216;Proxy type&#8217; radio buttons allow you to configure what type of proxy you want PuTTY to use for its network connections. The default setting is &#8216;None&#8217;; in this mode no proxy is used for any connection.
</p>
<ul><li>
Selecting <a name="i0"></a>&#8216;HTTP&#8217; allows you to proxy your connections through a web server supporting the HTTP <code>CONNECT</code> command, as documented in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2817.txt">RFC 2817</a>.
</li>
<li>
Selecting &#8216;SOCKS 4&#8217; or &#8216;SOCKS 5&#8217; allows you to proxy your connections through a <a name="i1"></a>SOCKS server.
</li>
<li>
Many firewalls implement a less formal type of proxy in which a user can make a Telnet or TCP connection directly to the firewall machine and enter a command such as <code>connect myhost.com 22</code> to connect through to an external host. Selecting <a name="i2"></a>&#8216;Telnet&#8217; allows you to tell PuTTY to use this type of proxy, with the precise command specified as described in <a href="config-proxy-command.html#S4.16.5">section 4.16.5</a>.
</li>
<li>
Selecting &#8216;SSH&#8217; causes PuTTY to make a secondary SSH connection to the proxy host (sometimes called a &#8216;<a name="i3"></a>jump host&#8217; in this context), and then open a port-forwarding channel to the final destination host.
<p>
The &#8216;Proxy hostname&#8217; field will be interpreted as the name of a PuTTY saved session if one exists, or a hostname if not. This allows multi-hop jump paths, if the referenced saved session is itself configured to use an SSH proxy; and it allows combining SSH and non-SSH proxying. 
</p>

</li>
<li>
Selecting <a name="i4"></a>&#8216;Local&#8217; allows you to specify an arbitrary command on the local machine to act as a proxy. When the session is started, instead of creating a TCP connection, PuTTY runs the command (specified in <a href="config-proxy-command.html#S4.16.5">section 4.16.5</a>), and uses its standard input and output streams.
<p>
This could be used, for instance, to talk to some kind of network proxy that PuTTY does not natively support; or you could tunnel a connection over something other than TCP/IP entirely.
</p>
<p>
You can also enable this mode on the command line; see <a href="using-cmdline-proxycmd.html#S3.11.3.26">section 3.11.3.26</a>.
