<h1><a name="S4.29.2"></a>4.29.2 Passive and active <a name="i0"></a>Telnet negotiation modes</h1>
<p>
In a Telnet connection, there are two types of data passed between the client and the server: actual text, and <em>negotiations</em> about which Telnet extra features to use.
</p>
<p>
PuTTY can use two different strategies for negotiation:
</p>
<ul><li>
In <a name="i1"></a><em>active</em> mode, PuTTY starts to send negotiations as soon as the connection is opened.
</li>
<li>
In <a name="i2"></a><em>passive</em> mode, PuTTY will wait to negotiate until it sees a negotiation from the server.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The obvious disadvantage of passive mode is that if the server is also operating in a passive mode, then negotiation will never begin at all. For this reason PuTTY defaults to active mode.
</p>
<p>
However, sometimes passive mode is required in order to successfully get through certain types of firewall and <a name="i3"></a>Telnet proxy server. If you have confusing trouble with a <a name="i4"></a>firewall, you could try enabling passive mode to see if it helps.
