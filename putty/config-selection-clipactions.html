<h1><a name="S4.11.4.2"></a>4.11.4.2 Choosing a clipboard for UI actions</h1>
<p>
PuTTY has three user-interface actions which can be configured to paste into the terminal (not counting menu items). You can click whichever mouse button (if any) is configured to paste (see <a href="config-mouse.html#S4.11.1">section 4.11.1</a>); you can press <a name="i0"></a>Shift-Ins; or you can press <a name="i1"></a>Ctrl-Shift-V, although that action is not enabled by default.
</p>
<p>
You can configure which of the available clipboards each of these actions pastes from (including turning the paste action off completely). On platforms with a single system clipboard (such as Windows), the available options are to paste from that clipboard or to paste from PuTTY's internal memory of the <a name="i2"></a>last selected text within that window. On X, the standard options are <code>CLIPBOARD</code> or <code>PRIMARY</code>.
</p>
<p>
(<code>PRIMARY</code> is conceptually similar in that it <em>also</em> refers to the last selected text &#8211; just across all applications instead of just this window.)
</p>
<p>
The two keyboard options each come with a corresponding key to copy <em>to</em> the same clipboard. Whatever you configure Shift-Ins to paste from, <a name="i3"></a>Ctrl-Ins will copy to the same location; similarly, <a name="i4"></a>Ctrl-Shift-C will copy to whatever Ctrl-Shift-V pastes from.
</p>
<p>
On X, you can also enter a selection name of your choice. For example, there is a rarely-used standard selection called &#8216;<a name="i5"></a><code>SECONDARY</code>&#8217;, which Emacs (for example) can work with if you hold down the Meta key while dragging to select or clicking to paste; if you configure a PuTTY keyboard action to access this clipboard, then you can interoperate with other applications' use of it. Another thing you could do would be to invent a clipboard name yourself, to create a special clipboard shared <em>only</em> between instances of PuTTY, or between just instances configured in that particular way.
