<h1><a name="S4.26.5"></a>4.26.5 &#8216;Ignores SSH-2 <a name="i0"></a>maximum packet size&#8217;</h1>
<p>
When an SSH-2 channel is set up, each end announces the maximum size of data packet that it is willing to receive for that channel. Some servers ignore PuTTY's announcement and send packets larger than PuTTY is willing to accept, causing it to report &#8216;Incoming packet was garbled on decryption&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
If this bug is detected, PuTTY never allows the channel's <a name="i1"></a>flow-control window to grow large enough to allow the server to send an over-sized packet. If this bug is enabled when talking to a correct server, the session will work correctly, but download performance will be less than it could be.
