<h1><a name="S4.26.8"></a>4.26.8 &#8216;Only supports pre-RFC4419 SSH-2 DH GEX&#8217;</h1>
<p>
The SSH key exchange method that uses Diffie-Hellman group exchange was redesigned after its original release, to use a slightly more sophisticated setup message. Almost all SSH implementations switched over to the new version. (PuTTY was one of the last.) A few old servers still only support the old one.
</p>
<p>
If this bug is detected, and the client and server negotiate Diffie-Hellman group exchange, then PuTTY will send the old message now known as <code>SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REQUEST_OLD</code> in place of the new <code>SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REQUEST</code>.
</p>
<p>
This is an SSH-2-specific bug.
