<h1><a name="S4.26.2"></a>4.26.2 &#8216;Handles SSH-2 key re-exchange badly&#8217;</h1>
<p>
Some SSH servers cannot cope with <a name="i0"></a>repeat key exchange at all, and will ignore attempts by the client to start one. Since PuTTY pauses the session while performing a repeat key exchange, the effect of this would be to cause the session to hang after an hour (unless you have your rekey timeout set differently; see <a href="config-ssh-kex-rekey.html#S4.18.2">section 4.18.2</a> for more about rekeys). Other, very old, SSH servers handle repeat key exchange even more badly, and disconnect upon receiving a repeat key exchange request.
</p>
<p>
If this bug is detected, PuTTY will never initiate a repeat key exchange. If this bug is enabled when talking to a correct server, the session should still function, but may be less secure than you would expect.
</p>
<p>
This is an SSH-2-specific bug.
