<h1><a name="S4.25.2"></a>4.25.2 Selecting <a name="i0"></a>Internet protocol version for forwarded ports</h1>
<p>
This switch allows you to select a specific Internet protocol (<a name="i1"></a>IPv4 or <a name="i2"></a>IPv6) for the local end of a forwarded port. By default, it is set on &#8216;Auto&#8217;, which means that:
</p>
<ul><li>
for a local-to-remote port forwarding, PuTTY will listen for incoming connections in both IPv4 and (if available) IPv6
</li>
<li>
for a remote-to-local port forwarding, PuTTY will choose a sensible protocol for the outgoing connection.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This overrides the general Internet protocol version preference on the Connection panel (see <a href="config-address-family.html#S4.14.4">section 4.14.4</a>).
</p>
<p>
Note that some operating systems may listen for incoming connections in IPv4 even if you specifically asked for IPv6, because their IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks are linked together. Apparently <a name="i3"></a>Linux does this, and Windows does not. So if you're running PuTTY on Windows and you tick &#8216;IPv6&#8217; for a local or dynamic port forwarding, it will <em>only</em> be usable by connecting to it using IPv6; whereas if you do the same on Linux, you can also use it with IPv4. However, ticking &#8216;Auto&#8217; should always give you a port which you can connect to using either protocol.
