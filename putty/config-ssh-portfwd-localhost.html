<h1><a name="S4.25.1"></a>4.25.1 Controlling the visibility of forwarded ports</h1>
<p>
The source port for a forwarded connection usually does not accept connections from any machine except the <a name="i0"></a>SSH client or server machine itself (for local and remote forwardings respectively). There are controls in the Tunnels panel to change this:
</p>
<ul><li>
The &#8216;Local ports accept connections from other hosts&#8217; option allows you to set up local-to-remote port forwardings in such a way that machines other than your client PC can connect to the forwarded port. (This also applies to dynamic SOCKS forwarding.)
</li>
<li>
The &#8216;Remote ports do the same&#8217; option does the same thing for remote-to-local port forwardings (so that machines other than the SSH server machine can connect to the forwarded port.) Note that this feature is only available in the SSH-2 protocol, and not all SSH-2 servers support it (<a name="i1"></a>OpenSSH 3.0 does not, for example).
</li>
</ul>
