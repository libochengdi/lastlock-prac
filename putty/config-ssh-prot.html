<h1><a name="S4.17.4"></a>4.17.4 &#8216;<a name="i0"></a>SSH protocol version&#8217;</h1>
<p>
This allows you to select whether to use <a name="i1"></a>SSH protocol version 2 or the older <a name="i2"></a>version 1.
</p>
<p>
You should normally leave this at the default of &#8216;2&#8217;. As well as having fewer features, the older SSH-1 protocol is no longer developed, has many known cryptographic weaknesses, and is generally not considered to be secure. PuTTY's protocol 1 implementation is provided mainly for compatibility, and is no longer being enhanced.
</p>
<p>
If a server offers both versions, prefer &#8216;2&#8217;. If you have some server or piece of equipment that only talks SSH-1, select &#8216;1&#8217; here, and do not treat the resulting connection as secure.
</p>
<p>
PuTTY will not automatically fall back to the other version of the protocol if the server turns out not to match your selection here; instead, it will put up an error message and abort the connection. This prevents an active attacker downgrading an intended SSH-2 connection to SSH-1.
