<h1><a name="S4.24.1"></a>4.24.1 Remote <a name="i0"></a>X11 authentication</h1>
<p>
If you are using X11 forwarding, the virtual X server created on the SSH server machine will be protected by authorisation data. This data is invented, and checked, by PuTTY.
</p>
<p>
The usual authorisation method used for this is called <a name="i1"></a><code>MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</code>. This is a simple password-style protocol: the X client sends some cookie data to the server, and the server checks that it matches the real cookie. The cookie data is sent over an unencrypted X11 connection; so if you allow a client on a third machine to access the virtual X server, then the cookie will be sent in the clear.
</p>
<p>
PuTTY offers the alternative protocol <a name="i2"></a><code>XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</code>. This is a cryptographically authenticated protocol: the data sent by the X client is different every time, and it depends on the IP address and port of the client's end of the connection and is also stamped with the current time. So an eavesdropper who captures an <code>XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</code> string cannot immediately re-use it for their own X connection.
</p>
<p>
PuTTY's support for <code>XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</code> is a somewhat experimental feature, and may encounter several problems:
</p>
<ul><li>
Some X clients probably do not even support <code>XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</code>, so they will not know what to do with the data PuTTY has provided.
</li>
<li>
This authentication mechanism will only work in SSH-2. In SSH-1, the SSH server does not tell the client the source address of a forwarded connection in a machine-readable format, so it's impossible to verify the <code>XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</code> data.
</li>
<li>
You may find this feature causes problems with some SSH servers, which will not clean up <code>XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</code> data after a session, so that if you then connect to the same server using a client which only does <code>MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</code> and are allocated the same remote display number, you might find that out-of-date authentication data is still present on your server and your X connections fail.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
PuTTY's default is <code>MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</code>. If you change it, you should be sure you know what you're doing.
