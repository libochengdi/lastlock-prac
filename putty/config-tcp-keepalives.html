<h1><a name="S4.14.3"></a>4.14.3 &#8216;Enable <a name="i0"></a>TCP keepalives&#8217;</h1>
<p>
<em>NOTE:</em> TCP keepalives should not be confused with the application-level keepalives described in <a href="config-keepalive.html#S4.14.1">section 4.14.1</a>. If in doubt, you probably want application-level keepalives; TCP keepalives are provided for completeness.
</p>
<p>
The idea of TCP keepalives is similar to application-level keepalives, and the same caveats apply. The main differences are:
</p>
<ul><li>
TCP keepalives are available on <em>all</em> network connection types, including Raw, Rlogin, and SUPDUP.
</li>
<li>
The interval between TCP keepalives is usually much longer, typically two hours; this is set by the operating system, and cannot be configured within PuTTY.
</li>
<li>
If the operating system does not receive a response to a keepalive, it may send out more in quick succession and terminate the connection if no response is received.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
TCP keepalives may be more useful for ensuring that <a name="i1"></a>half-open connections are terminated than for keeping a connection alive.
</p>
<p>
TCP keepalives are disabled by default.
