<p>
Most servers you might connect to with PuTTY are designed to be connected to from lots of different types of terminal. In order to send the right <a name="i1"></a>control sequences to each one, the server will need to know what type of terminal it is dealing with. Therefore, each of the SSH, Telnet, and Rlogin protocols allow a text string to be sent down the connection describing the terminal. On a <a name="i2"></a>Unix server, this selects an entry from the <a name="i3"></a><code>termcap</code> or <a name="i4"></a><code>terminfo</code> database that tells applications what <a name="i5"></a>control sequences to send to the terminal, and what character sequences to expect the <a name="i6"></a>keyboard to generate.
</p>
<p>
PuTTY attempts to emulate the Unix <a name="i7"></a><code>xterm</code> program, and by default it reflects this by sending <code>xterm</code> as a terminal-type string. If you find this is not doing what you want - perhaps the remote system reports &#8216;Unknown terminal type&#8217; - you could try setting this to something different, such as <a name="i8"></a><code>vt220</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you're not sure whether a problem is due to the terminal type setting or not, you probably need to consult the manual for your application or your server.
