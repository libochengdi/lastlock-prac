<h1><a name="S10.13"></a>10.13 &#8216;Incoming packet was garbled on decryption&#8217;</h1>
<p>
This error occurs when PuTTY decrypts an SSH packet and the decrypted data makes no sense. This probably means something has gone wrong in the encryption or decryption process. It's difficult to tell from this error message whether the problem is in the client, in the server, or in between.

If you get this error, one thing you could try would be to fiddle with the setting of &#8216;Miscomputes SSH-2 encryption keys&#8217; (see <a href="config-ssh-bug-derivekey2.html#S4.26.11">section 4.26.11</a>) or &#8216;Ignores SSH-2 maximum packet size&#8217; (see <a href="config-ssh-bug-maxpkt2.html#S4.26.5">section 4.26.5</a>) on the Bugs panel.
