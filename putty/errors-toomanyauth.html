<h1><a name="S10.5"></a>10.5 &#8216;Remote side sent disconnect message type 2 (protocol error): "Too many authentication failures for root"&#8217;</h1>
<p>
This message is produced by an <a name="i0"></a>OpenSSH (or <a name="i1"></a>Sun SSH) server if it receives more failed authentication attempts than it is willing to tolerate.
</p>
<p>
This can easily happen if you are using Pageant and have a large number of keys loaded into it, since these servers count each offer of a public key as an authentication attempt. This can be worked around by specifying the key that's required for the authentication in the PuTTY configuration (see <a href="config-ssh-privkey.html#S4.21.9">section 4.21.9</a>); PuTTY will ignore any other keys Pageant may have, but will ask Pageant to do the authentication, so that you don't have to type your passphrase.
</p>
<p>
On the server, this can be worked around by disabling public-key authentication or (for Sun SSH only) by increasing <code>MaxAuthTries</code> in <code>sshd_config</code>.
