<h1><a name="QA.7.17"></a>A.7.17 Since I upgraded <a name="i0"></a>Windows XP to Service Pack 2, I can't use addresses like <code>127.0.0.2</code>.</h1>
<p>
Some people who ask PuTTY to listen on <a name="i1"></a>localhost addresses other than <code>127.0.0.1</code> to forward services such as <a name="i2"></a>SMB and <a name="i3"></a>Windows Terminal Services have found that doing so no longer works since they upgraded to WinXP SP2.
</p>
<p>
This is apparently an issue with SP2 that is acknowledged by Microsoft in MS Knowledge Base article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;884020">884020</a>. The article links to a fix you can download.
</p>
<p>
(<em>However</em>, we've been told that SP2 <em>also</em> fixes the bug that means you need to use non-<code>127.0.0.1</code> addresses to forward Terminal Services in the first place.)
