You almost certainly need to change the &#8216;Use <a name="i0"></a>background colour to erase screen&#8217; setting in the Terminal panel. If there is too much black space (the commoner situation), you should enable it, while if there is too much colour, you should disable it. (See <a href="config-erase.html#S4.3.5">section 4.3.5</a>.)

In old versions of PuTTY, this was disabled by default, and would not take effect until you reset the terminal (see <a href="faq-resetterm.html#QA.7.7">question A.7.7</a>). Since 0.54, it is enabled by default, and changes take effect immediately.
