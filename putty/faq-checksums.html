<h1><a name="QA.9.17"></a>A.9.17 The <code>sha1sums</code> / <code>sha256sums</code> / etc files on your download page don't match the binaries.</h1>
<p>
People report this every so often, and usually the reason turns out to be that they've matched up the wrong checksums file with the wrong binaries.
</p>
<p>
The PuTTY download page contains more than one version of the software. There's a <em>latest release</em> version; there are the <em>development snapshots</em>; and when we're in the run-up to making a release, there are also <em>pre-release</em> builds of the upcoming new version. Each one has its own collection of binaries, and its own collection of checksums files to go with them.
</p>
<p>
So if you've downloaded the release version of the actual program, you need the release version of the checksums too, otherwise you will see a mismatch. Similarly, the development snapshot binaries go with the development snapshot checksums, and so on. (We've colour-coded the download page in an effort to reduce this confusion a bit.)
</p>
<p>
Another thing to watch out for: as of 0.71, executables like <code>putty.exe</code> come in two flavours for each platform: the standalone versions on the website, each of which contains embedded help, and the versions installed by the installer, which use a separate help file also in the installer. We provide checksums for both; the latter are indicated with &#8216;<code>(installer version)</code>&#8217; after the filename.
</p>
<p>
If you have double-checked all that, and you still think there's a real mismatch, then please send us a report carefully quoting everything relevant:
</p>
<ul><li>
the exact URL you got your binary from
</li>
<li>
the checksum of the binary after you downloaded
</li>
<li>
the exact URL you got your checksums file from
</li>
<li>
the checksum that file says the binary should have.
</li>
</ul>
