<h1><a name="QA.8.2"></a>A.8.2 What does PuTTY leave on a system? How can I <a name="i0"></a>clean up after it?</h1>
<p>
PuTTY will leave some Registry entries, and a random seed file, on the PC (see <a href="faq-settings.html#QA.5.2">question A.5.2</a>). Windows 7 and up also remember some information about recently launched sessions for the &#8216;jump list&#8217; feature.
</p>
<p>
If you are using PuTTY on a public PC, or somebody else's PC, you might want to clean this information up when you leave. You can do that automatically, by running the command <code>putty -cleanup</code>. See <a href="using-cleanup.html#S3.11.2">section 3.11.2</a> in the documentation for more detail. (Note that this only removes settings for the currently logged-in user on <a name="i1"></a>multi-user systems.)
</p>
<p>
If PuTTY was installed from the installer package, it will also appear in &#8216;Add/Remove Programs&#8217;. Current versions of the installer do not offer to remove the above-mentioned items, so if you want them removed you should run <code>putty -cleanup</code> before uninstalling.
