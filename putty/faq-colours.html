That isn't how you're supposed to use the Colours panel.
</p>
<p>
During the course of a session, PuTTY potentially uses <em>all</em> the colours listed in the Colours panel. It's not a question of using only one of them and you choosing which one; PuTTY will use them <em>all</em>. The purpose of the Colours panel is to let you adjust the appearance of all the colours. So to change the colour of the cursor, for example, you would select &#8216;Cursor Colour&#8217;, press the &#8216;Modify&#8217; button, and select a new colour from the dialog box that appeared. Similarly, if you want your session to appear in green, you should select &#8216;Default Foreground&#8217; and press &#8216;Modify&#8217;. Clicking on &#8216;ANSI Green&#8217; won't turn your session green; it will only allow you to adjust the <em>shade</em> of green used when PuTTY is instructed by the server to display green text.
