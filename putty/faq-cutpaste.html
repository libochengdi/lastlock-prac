<p>
Copy and paste works similarly to the X Window System. You use the left mouse button to select text in the PuTTY window. The act of selection <em>automatically</em> copies the text to the clipboard: there is no need to press Ctrl-Ins or Ctrl-C or anything else. In fact, pressing Ctrl-C will send a Ctrl-C character to the other end of your connection (just like it does the rest of the time), which may have unpleasant effects. The <em>only</em> thing you need to do, to copy text to the clipboard, is to select it.
</p>
<p>
To paste the clipboard contents into a PuTTY window, by default you click the right mouse button. If you have a three-button mouse and are used to X applications, you can configure pasting to be done by the middle button instead, but this is not the default because most Windows users don't have a middle button at all.

You can also paste by pressing Shift-Ins.
