<h1><a name="QA.3.7"></a>A.3.7 Will there be a port to EPOC?</h1>
<p>
I hope so, but given that ports aren't really progressing very fast even on systems the developers <em>do</em> already know how to program for, it might be a long time before any of us get round to learning a new system and doing the port for that.

However, some of the work has been done by other people; see the <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/links.html">Links page of our website</a> for various third-party ports.
