<h1><a name="QA.3.8"></a>A.3.8 Will there be a port to the iPhone?</h1>
<p>
We have no plans to write such a port ourselves; none of us has an iPhone, and developing and publishing applications for it looks awkward and expensive.
</p>
<p>
However, there is a third-party SSH client for the iPhone and iPod&nbsp;Touch called <a href="http://www.instantcocoa.com/products/pTerm/">pTerm</a>, which is apparently based on PuTTY. (This is nothing to do with our similarly-named <code>pterm</code>, which is a standalone terminal emulator for Unix systems; see <a href="faq-unix.html#QA.3.2">question A.3.2</a>.)
