<p>
This is not a question you should be asking <em>us</em>.
</p>
<p>
PuTTY is a communications tool, for making connections to other computers. We maintain the tool; we <em>don't</em> administer any computers that you're likely to be able to use, in the same way that the people who make web browsers aren't responsible for most of the content you can view in them. We cannot help with questions of this sort.
</p>
<p>
If you know the name of the computer you want to connect to, but don't know what login name or password to use, you should talk to whoever administers that computer. If you don't know who that is, see the next question for some possible ways to find out.
