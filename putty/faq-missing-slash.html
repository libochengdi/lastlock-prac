<h1><a name="QA.7.18"></a>A.7.18 PSFTP commands seem to be missing a directory separator (slash).</h1>
<p>
Some people have reported the following incorrect behaviour with PSFTP:
</p>
<pre><code>psftp&gt; <em>pwd</em>
Remote directory is /dir1/dir2
psftp&gt; <em>get filename.ext</em>
/dir1/dir2filename.ext: no such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p>
This is not a bug in PSFTP. There is a known bug in some versions of portable <a name="i0"></a>OpenSSH (<a href="http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=697">bug 697</a>) that causes these symptoms; it appears to have been introduced around 3.7.x. It manifests only on certain platforms (AIX is what has been reported to us).
</p>
<p>
There is a patch for OpenSSH attached to that bug; it's also fixed in recent versions of portable OpenSSH (from around 3.8).
