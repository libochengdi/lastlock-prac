<h1><a name="QA.7.4"></a>A.7.4 When attempting a file transfer, either PSCP or PSFTP says &#8216;<a name="i0"></a>Out of memory&#8217; and dies.</h1>
<p>
This is almost always caused by your <a name="i1"></a>login scripts on the server generating output. PSCP or PSFTP will receive that output when they were expecting to see the start of a file transfer protocol, and they will attempt to interpret the output as file-transfer protocol. This will usually lead to an &#8216;out of memory&#8217; error for much the same reasons as given in <a href="faq-outofmem.html#QA.7.3">question A.7.3</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is a setup problem in your account on your server, <em>not</em> a PSCP/PSFTP bug. Your login scripts should <em>never</em> generate output during non-interactive sessions; secure file transfer is not the only form of remote access that will break if they do.
</p>
<p>
On Unix, a simple fix is to ensure that all the parts of your login script that might generate output are in <code>.profile</code> (if you use a Bourne shell derivative) or <code>.login</code> (if you use a C shell). Putting them in more general files such as <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.cshrc</code> is liable to lead to problems.
