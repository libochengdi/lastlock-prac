<p>
No, it doesn't.
</p>
<p>
Remembering your password is a bad plan for obvious security reasons: anyone who gains access to your machine while you're away from your desk can find out the remembered password, and use it, abuse it or change it.
</p>
<p>
In addition, it's not even <em>possible</em> for PuTTY to automatically send your password in a Telnet session, because Telnet doesn't give the client software any indication of which part of the login process is the password prompt. PuTTY would have to guess, by looking for words like &#8216;password&#8217; in the session data; and if your login program is written in something other than English, this won't work.
</p>
<p>
In SSH, remembering your password would be possible in theory, but there doesn't seem to be much point since SSH supports public key authentication, which is more flexible and more secure. See <a href="pubkey.html#C8">chapter 8</a> in the documentation for a full discussion of public key authentication.
