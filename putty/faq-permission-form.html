<h1><a name="QA.9.11"></a>A.9.11 Can you sign this form granting us permission to use/distribute PuTTY?</h1>
<p>
If your form contains any clause along the lines of &#8216;the undersigned represents and warrants&#8217;, we're not going to sign it. This is particularly true if it asks us to warrant that PuTTY is secure; see <a href="faq-indemnity.html#QA.9.10">question A.9.10</a> for more discussion of this. But it doesn't really matter what we're supposed to be warranting: even if it's something we already believe is true, such as that we don't infringe any third-party copyright, we will not sign a document accepting any legal or financial liability. This is simply because the PuTTY development project has no income out of which to satisfy that liability, or pay legal costs, should it become necessary. We cannot afford to be sued. We are assuring you that <em>we have done our best</em>; if that isn't good enough for you, tough.
</p>
<p>
The existing PuTTY licence document already gives you permission to use or distribute PuTTY in pretty much any way which does not involve pretending you wrote it or suing us if it goes wrong. We think that really ought to be enough for anybody.

<p>
See also <a href="faq-permission-general.html#QA.9.13">question A.9.13</a> for another reason why we don't want to do this sort of thing.
