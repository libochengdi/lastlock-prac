<h1><a name="QA.9.12"></a>A.9.12 Can you write us a formal notice of permission to use PuTTY?</h1>
<p>
We could, in principle, but it isn't clear what use it would be. If you think there's a serious chance of one of the PuTTY copyright holders suing you (which we don't!), you would presumably want a signed notice from <em>all</em> of them; and we couldn't provide that even if we wanted to, because many of the copyright holders are people who contributed some code in the past and with whom we subsequently lost contact. Therefore the best we would be able to do <em>even in theory</em> would be to have the core development team sign the document, which wouldn't guarantee you that some other copyright holder might not sue.

See also <a href="faq-permission-general.html#QA.9.13">question A.9.13</a> for another reason why we don't want to do this sort of thing.
