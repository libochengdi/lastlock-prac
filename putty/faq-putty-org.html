<h1><a name="QA.9.1"></a>A.9.1 Is <code>putty.org</code> your website?</h1>
<p>
No, it isn't. <code>putty.org</code> is run by an opportunist who uses it to advertise their own commercial SSH implementation to people looking for our free one. We don't own that site, we can't control it, and we don't advise anyone to use it in preference to our own site.
</p>
<p>
The real PuTTY web site, run by the PuTTY team, has always been at <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"><code>https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</code></a>.
