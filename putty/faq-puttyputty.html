<p>
Don't do that, then.
</p>
<p>
This is designed behaviour; when PuTTY receives the character Control-E from the remote server, it interprets it as a request to identify itself, and so it sends back the string &#8216;<code>PuTTY</code>&#8217; as if that string had been entered at the keyboard. Control-E should only be sent by programs that are prepared to deal with the response. Writing a binary file to your terminal is likely to output many Control-E characters, and cause this behaviour. Don't do it. It's a bad plan.

<p>
To mitigate the effects, you could configure the answerback string to be empty (see <a href="config-answerback.html#S4.3.7">section 4.3.7</a>); but writing binary files to your terminal is likely to cause various other unpleasant behaviour, so this is only a small remedy.
