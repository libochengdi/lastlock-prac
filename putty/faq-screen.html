<h1><a name="QA.7.16"></a>A.7.16 Since I upgraded to PuTTY 0.54, the scrollback has stopped working when I run <code>screen</code>.</h1>
<p>
PuTTY's terminal emulator has always had the policy that when the &#8216;<a name="i0"></a>alternate screen&#8217; is in use, nothing is added to the scrollback. This is because the usual sorts of programs which use the alternate screen are things like text editors, which tend to scroll back and forth in the same document a lot; so (a) they would fill up the scrollback with a large amount of unhelpfully disordered text, and (b) they contain their <em>own</em> method for the user to scroll back to the bit they were interested in. We have generally found this policy to do the Right Thing in almost all situations.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, <code>screen</code> is one exception: it uses the alternate screen, but it's still usually helpful to have PuTTY's scrollback continue working. The simplest solution is to go to the Features control panel and tick &#8216;Disable switching to alternate terminal screen&#8217;. (See <a href="config-features-altscreen.html#S4.6.4">section 4.6.4</a> for more details.) Alternatively, you can tell <code>screen</code> itself not to use the alternate screen: the <a href="http://www4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~jnweiger/screen-faq.html"><code>screen</code> FAQ</a> suggests adding the line &#8216;<code>termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@</code>&#8217; to your <code>.screenrc</code> file.
</p>
<p>
The reason why this only started to be a problem in 0.54 is because <code>screen</code> typically uses an unusual control sequence to switch to the alternate screen, and previous versions of PuTTY did not support this sequence.
