<p>
Not one that you'd want to use.
</p>
<p>
While much of the protocol and networking code can be made common between a client and server, to make a <em>useful</em> general-purpose server requires all sorts of fiddly new code like interacting with OS authentication databases and the like.
</p>
<p>
A special-purpose SSH server (called <a name="i0"></a>Uppity) can now be built from the PuTTY source code, and indeed it is not usable as a general-purpose server; it exists mainly as a test harness.
</p>
<p>
If someone else wants to use this as a basis for writing a general-purpose SSH server, they'd be perfectly welcome to of course; but we don't have time, and we don't have motivation. The code is available if anyone else wants to try it.
