<h1><a name="QA.5.2"></a>A.5.2 Where does PuTTY store its data?</h1>
<p>
On Windows, PuTTY stores most of its data (saved sessions, SSH host keys) in the <a name="i0"></a>Registry. The precise location is
</p>
<pre><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY
</code></pre>
<p>
and within that area, saved sessions are stored under <code>Sessions</code> while host keys are stored under <code>SshHostKeys</code>.
</p>
<p>
PuTTY also requires a random number seed file, to improve the unpredictability of randomly chosen data needed as part of the SSH cryptography. This is stored by default in a file called <a name="i1"></a><code>PUTTY.RND</code>; this is stored by default in the &#8216;Application Data&#8217; directory, or failing that, one of a number of fallback locations. If you want to change the location of the random number seed file, you can put your chosen pathname in the Registry, at
</p>
<pre><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\RandSeedFile
</code></pre>
<p>
You can ask PuTTY to delete all this data; see <a href="faq-cleanup.html#QA.8.2">question A.8.2</a>.
</p>
<p>
On Unix, PuTTY stores all of this data in a directory <code>~/.putty</code> by default.
