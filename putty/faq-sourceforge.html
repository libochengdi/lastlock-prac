<h1><a name="QA.9.5"></a>A.9.5 Why don't you move PuTTY to SourceForge?</h1>
<p>
Partly, because we don't want to move the web site location (see <a href="faq-domain.html#QA.9.2">question A.9.2</a>).
</p>
<p>
Also, security reasons. PuTTY is a security product, and as such it is particularly important to guard the code and the web site against unauthorised modifications which might introduce subtle security flaws. Therefore, we prefer that the Git repository, web site and FTP site remain where they are, under the direct control of system administrators we know and trust personally, rather than being run by a large organisation full of people we've never met and which is known to have had breakins in the past.
</p>
<p>
No offence to SourceForge; I think they do a wonderful job. But they're not ideal for everyone, and in particular they're not ideal for us.
