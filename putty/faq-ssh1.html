<h1><a name="QA.2.3"></a>A.2.3 Does PuTTY support SSH-1?</h1>
<p>
Yes. SSH-1 support has always been available in PuTTY.
</p>
<p>
However, the SSH-1 protocol has many weaknesses and is no longer considered secure; you should use SSH-2 instead if at all possible.
</p>
<p>
As of 0.68, PuTTY will no longer fall back to SSH-1 if the server doesn't appear to support SSH-2; you must explicitly ask for SSH-1.
