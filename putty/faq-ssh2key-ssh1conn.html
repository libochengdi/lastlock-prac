<p>
It's likely that you've generated an SSH protocol 2 key with PuTTYgen, but you're trying to use it in an SSH-1 connection. SSH-1 and SSH-2 keys have different formats, and (at least in 0.52) PuTTY's reporting of a key in the wrong format isn't optimal.
</p>
<p>
To connect using SSH-2 to a server that supports both versions, you need to change the configuration from the default (see <a href="faq-ssh2.html#QA.2.1">question A.2.1</a>).
