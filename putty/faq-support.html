<h1><a name="SA.2"></a>A.2 Features supported in PuTTY</h1>
<p>
<a name="i0"></a>In general, if you want to know if PuTTY supports a particular feature, you should look for it on the <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY web site</a>. In particular:
</p>
<ul><li>
try the <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/changes.html">changes page</a>, and see if you can find the feature on there. If a feature is listed there, it's been implemented. If it's listed as a change made <em>since</em> the latest version, it should be available in the development snapshots, in which case testing will be very welcome.
</li>
<li>
try the <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/">Wishlist page</a>, and see if you can find the feature there. If it's on there, and not in the &#8216;Recently fixed&#8217; section, it probably <em>hasn't</em> been implemented.
</li>
</ul>
