<h1><a name="QA.3.2"></a>A.3.2 <a name="i0"></a>Is there a port to Unix?</h1>
<p>
There are Unix ports of most of the traditional PuTTY tools, and also one entirely new application.
</p>
<p>
If you look at the source release, you should find a <code>unix</code> subdirectory. There are a couple of ways of building it, including the usual <code>configure</code>/<code>make</code>; see the file <code>README</code> in the source distribution. This should build you:
</p>
<ul><li>
Unix ports of PuTTY, Plink, PSCP, and PSFTP, which work pretty much the same as their Windows counterparts;
</li>
<li>
Command-line versions of PuTTYgen and Pageant, whose user interface is quite different to the Windows GUI versions;
</li>
<li>
<a name="i1"></a><code>pterm</code> - an <code>xterm</code>-type program which supports the same terminal emulation as PuTTY.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you don't have <a name="i2"></a>Gtk, you should still be able to build the command-line tools.
