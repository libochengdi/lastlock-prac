<h1><a name="QA.7.21"></a>A.7.21 PuTTY fails to start up. Windows claims that &#8216;the application configuration is incorrect&#8217;.</h1>
<p>
This is caused by a bug in certain versions of <a name="i0"></a>Windows XP which is triggered by PuTTY 0.58. This was fixed in 0.59. The <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/xp-wont-run">&#8216;xp-wont-run&#8217;</a> entry in PuTTY's wishlist has more details.
