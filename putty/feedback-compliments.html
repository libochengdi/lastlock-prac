<h1><a name="SB.10"></a>B.10 Praise and compliments</h1>
<p>
One of the most rewarding things about maintaining free software is getting e-mails that just say &#8216;thanks&#8217;. We are always happy to receive e-mails of this type.
</p>
<p>
Regrettably we don't have time to answer them all in person. If you mail us a compliment and don't receive a reply, <em>please</em> don't think we've ignored you. We did receive it and we were happy about it; we just didn't have time to tell you so personally.
</p>
<p>
To everyone who's ever sent us praise and compliments, in the past and the future: <em>you're welcome</em>!
