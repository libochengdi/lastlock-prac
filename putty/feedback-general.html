<h1><a name="SB.1"></a>B.1 General guidelines</h1>
<p>
The PuTTY development team gets a <em>lot</em> of mail. If you can possibly solve your own problem by reading the manual, reading the FAQ, reading the web site, asking a fellow user, perhaps posting to a newsgroup (see <a href="feedback-other-fora.html#SB.1.2">section B.1.2</a>), or some other means, then it would make our lives much easier.
</p>
<p>
We get so much e-mail that we literally do not have time to answer it all. We regret this, but there's nothing we can do about it. So if you can <em>possibly</em> avoid sending mail to the PuTTY team, we recommend you do so. In particular, support requests (<a href="feedback-support.html#SB.6">section B.6</a>) are probably better sent to newsgroups, or passed to a local expert if possible.
</p>
<p>
The PuTTY contact email address is a private <a name="i0"></a>mailing list containing four or five core developers. Don't be put off by it being a mailing list: if you need to send confidential data as part of a bug report, you can trust the people on the list to respect that confidence. Also, the archives aren't publicly available, so you shouldn't be letting yourself in for any spam by sending us mail.
</p>
<p>
Please use a meaningful subject line on your message. We get a lot of mail, and it's hard to find the message we're looking for if they all have subject lines like &#8216;PuTTY bug&#8217;.
