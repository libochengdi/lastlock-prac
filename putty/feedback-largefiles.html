<h1><a name="SB.1.1"></a>B.1.1 Sending large attachments</h1>
<p>
Since the PuTTY contact address is a mailing list, e-mails larger than 40Kb will be held for inspection by the list administrator, and will not be allowed through unless they really appear to be worth their large size.
</p>
<p>
If you are considering sending any kind of large data file to the PuTTY team, it's almost always a bad idea, or at the very least it would be better to ask us first whether we actually need the file. Alternatively, you could put the file on a web site and just send us the URL; that way, we don't have to download it unless we decide we actually need it, and only one of us needs to download it instead of it being automatically copied to all the developers.
</p>
<p>
(If the file contains confidential information, then you could encrypt it with our Secure Contact Key; see <a href="pgpkeys-pubkey.html#SF.1">section F.1</a> for details. Please <em>only</em> use this for information that <em>needs</em> to be confidential.)
</p>
<p>
Some people like to send mail in MS Word format. Please <em>don't</em> send us bug reports, or any other mail, as a Word document. Word documents are roughly fifty times larger than writing the same report in plain text. In addition, most of the PuTTY team read their e-mail on Unix machines, so copying the file to a Windows box to run Word is very inconvenient. Not only that, but several of us don't even <em>have</em> a copy of Word!
</p>
<p>
Some people like to send us screen shots when demonstrating a problem. Please don't do this without checking with us first - we almost never actually need the information in the screen shot. Sending a screen shot of an error box is almost certainly unnecessary when you could just tell us in plain text what the error was. (On some versions of Windows, pressing Ctrl-C when the error box is displayed will copy the text of the message to the clipboard.) Sending a full-screen shot is <em>occasionally</em> useful, but it's probably still wise to check whether we need it before sending it.
</p>
<p>
If you <em>must</em> mail a screen shot, don't send it as a <code>.BMP</code> file. <code>BMP</code>s have no compression and they are <em>much</em> larger than other image formats such as PNG, TIFF and GIF. Convert the file to a properly compressed image format before sending it.
</p>
<p>
Please don't mail us executables, at all. Our mail server blocks all incoming e-mail containing executables, as a defence against the vast numbers of e-mail viruses we receive every day. If you mail us an executable, it will just bounce.
</p>
<p>
If you have made a tiny modification to the PuTTY code, please send us a <em>patch</em> to the source code if possible, rather than sending us a huge <code>.ZIP</code> file containing the complete sources plus your modification. If you've only changed 10 lines, we'd prefer to receive a mail that's 30 lines long than one containing multiple megabytes of data we already have.
