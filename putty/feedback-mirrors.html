<h1><a name="SB.9"></a>B.9 Mirroring the PuTTY web site</h1>
<p>
If you want to set up a mirror of the PuTTY website, go ahead and set one up. Please don't bother asking us for permission before setting up a mirror. You already have permission.
</p>
<p>
If the mirror is in a country where we don't already have plenty of mirrors, we may be willing to add it to the list on our <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/mirrors.html">mirrors page</a>. Read the guidelines on that page, make sure your mirror works, and email us the information listed at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>
Note that we do not <em>promise</em> to list your mirror: we get a lot of mirror notifications and yours may not happen to find its way to the top of the list.
</p>
<p>
Also note that we link to all our mirror sites using the <code>rel="nofollow"</code> attribute. Running a PuTTY mirror is not intended to be a cheap way to gain search rankings.
</p>
<p>
If you have technical questions about the process of mirroring, then you might want to mail us before setting up the mirror (see also the <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/mirrors.html#guidelines">guidelines on the Mirrors page</a>); but if you just want to ask for permission, you don't need to. You already have permission.
