<h1><a name="SB.8"></a>B.8 Asking permission for things</h1>
<p>
PuTTY is distributed under the MIT Licence (see <a href="licence.html#AD">appendix D</a> for details). This means you can do almost <em>anything</em> you like with our software, our source code, and our documentation. The only things you aren't allowed to do are to remove our copyright notices or the licence text itself, or to hold us legally responsible if something goes wrong.
</p>
<p>
So if you want permission to include PuTTY on a magazine cover disk, or as part of a collection of useful software on a CD or a web site, then <em>permission is already granted</em>. You don't have to mail us and ask. Just go ahead and do it. We don't mind.
</p>
<p>
(If you want to distribute PuTTY alongside your own application for use with that application, or if you want to distribute PuTTY within your own organisation, then we recommend, but do not insist, that you offer your own first-line technical support, to answer questions about the interaction of PuTTY with your environment. If your users mail us directly, we won't be able to tell them anything useful about your specific setup.)
</p>
<p>
If you want to use parts of the PuTTY source code in another program, then it might be worth mailing us to talk about technical details, but if all you want is to ask permission then you don't need to bother. You already have permission.
</p>
<p>
If you just want to link to our web site, just go ahead. (It's not clear that we <em>could</em> stop you doing this, even if we wanted to!)
