<h1><a name="SB.3"></a>B.3 Reporting security vulnerabilities</h1>
<p>
If you've found a security vulnerability in PuTTY, you might well want to notify us using an encrypted communications channel, to avoid disclosing information about the vulnerability before a fixed release is available.
</p>
<p>
For this purpose, we provide a GPG key suitable for encryption: the Secure Contact Key. See <a href="pgpkeys-pubkey.html#SF.1">section F.1</a> for details of this.
</p>
<p>
(Of course, vulnerabilities are also bugs, so please do include as much information as possible about them, the same way you would with any other bug report.)
