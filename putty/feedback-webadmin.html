<h1><a name="SB.7"></a>B.7 Web server administration</h1>
<p>
If the PuTTY <a name="i0"></a>web site is down (Connection Timed Out), please don't bother mailing us to tell us about it. Most of us read our e-mail on the same machines that host the web site, so if those machines are down then we will notice <em>before</em> we read our e-mail. So there's no point telling us our servers are down.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if the web site has some other error (Connection Refused, 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden, or something else) then we might <em>not</em> have noticed and it might still be worth telling us about it.
</p>
<p>
If you want to report a problem with our web site, check that you're looking at our <em>real</em> web site and not a mirror. The real web site is at <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"><code>https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</code></a>; if that's not where you're reading this, then don't report the problem to us until you've checked that it's really a problem with the main site. If it's only a problem with the mirror, you should try to contact the administrator of that mirror site first, and only contact us if that doesn't solve the problem (in case we need to remove the mirror from our list).
