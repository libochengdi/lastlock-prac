<h1><a name="SF.2.2"></a>F.2.2 The Releases key</h1>
<p>
The Releases key is more secure: because it is only used at release time, to sign each release by hand, we can store it encrypted.
</p>
<p>
The Releases private key is kept encrypted on the developers' own local machines. So an attacker wanting to steal it would have to also steal the passphrase.
