<h1><a name="SF.2.1"></a>F.2.1 The Development Snapshots key</h1>
<p>
The Development Snapshots private key is stored <em>without a passphrase</em>. This is necessary, because the snapshots are generated every night without human intervention, so nobody would be able to type a passphrase.
</p>
<p>
The snapshots are built and signed on a team member's home computers, before being uploaded to the web server from which you download them.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, a signature from the Development Snapshots key <em>DOES</em> protect you against:
</p>
<ul><li>
People tampering with the PuTTY binaries between the PuTTY web site and you.
</li>
<li>
The maintainers of our web server attempting to abuse their root privilege to tamper with the binaries.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But it <em>DOES NOT</em> protect you against:
</p>
<ul><li>
People tampering with the binaries before they are uploaded to our download servers.
</li>
<li>
People tampering with the build machines so that the next set of binaries they build will be malicious in some way.
</li>
<li>
People stealing the unencrypted private key from the build machine it lives on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of course, we take all reasonable precautions to guard the build machines. But when you see a signature, you should always be certain of precisely what it guarantees and precisely what it does not.
