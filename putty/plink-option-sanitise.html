<p>
In some situations, Plink applies a sanitisation pass to the output received from the server, to strip out control characters such as backspace and the escape character.
</p>
<p>
The idea of this is to prevent remote processes from sending confusing escape sequences through the standard error channel when Plink is being used as a transport for something like <code>git</code> or CVS. If the server actually wants to send an error message, it will probably be plain text; if the server abuses that channel to try to write over unexpected parts of your terminal display, Plink will try to stop it.
</p>
<p>
By default, this only happens for output channels which are sent to a Windows console device, or a Unix terminal device. (Any output stream going somewhere else is likely to be needed by an 8-bit protocol and must not be tampered with at all.) It also stops happening if you tell Plink to allocate a remote pseudo-terminal (see <a href="using-cmdline-pty.html#S3.11.3.12">section 3.11.3.12</a> and <a href="config-ssh-pty.html#S4.23.1">section 4.23.1</a>), on the basis that in that situation you often <em>want</em> escape sequences from the server to go to your terminal.
</p>
<p>
But in case Plink guesses wrong about whether you want this sanitisation, you can override it in either direction, using one of these options:
</p>
<dl><dt>
<code>-sanitise-stderr</code>
</dt>
<dd>
Sanitise server data written to Plink's standard error channel, regardless of terminals and consoles and remote ptys.
</dd>
<dt>
<code>-no-sanitise-stderr</code>
</dt>
<dd>
Do not sanitise server data written to Plink's standard error channel.
</dd>
<dt>
<code>-sanitise-stdout</code>
</dt>
<dd>
Sanitise server data written to Plink's standard output channel.
</dd>
<dt>
<code>-no-sanitise-stdout</code>
</dt>
<dd>
Do not sanitise server data written to Plink's standard output channel.
</dd>
