<h1><a name="S5.1"></a>5.1 Starting PSCP</h1>
<p>
PSCP is a command line application. This means that you cannot just double-click on its icon to run it and instead you have to bring up a <a name="i0"></a>console window. With Windows 95, 98, and ME, this is called an &#8216;MS-DOS Prompt&#8217; and with Windows NT, 2000, and XP, it is called a &#8216;Command Prompt&#8217;. It should be available from the Programs section of your <a name="i1"></a>Start Menu.
</p>
<p>
To start PSCP it will need either to be on your <a name="i2"></a><code>PATH</code> or in your current directory. To add the directory containing PSCP to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable, type into the console window:
</p>
<pre><code>set PATH=C:\path\to\putty\directory;%PATH%
</code></pre>
<p>
This will only work for the lifetime of that particular console window. To set your <code>PATH</code> more permanently on Windows NT, 2000, and XP, use the Environment tab of the System Control Panel. On Windows 95, 98, and ME, you will need to edit your <a name="i3"></a><code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> to include a <code>set</code> command like the one above.
