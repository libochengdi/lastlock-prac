<h1><a name="S8.2.6"></a>8.2.6 The &#8216;<a name="i0"></a>Key fingerprint&#8217; box</h1>
<p>
The &#8216;Key fingerprint&#8217; box shows you a fingerprint value for the generated key. This is derived cryptographically from the <em>public</em> key value, so it doesn't need to be kept secret; it is supposed to be more manageable for human beings than the public key itself.
</p>
<p>
The fingerprint value is intended to be cryptographically secure, in the sense that it is computationally infeasible for someone to invent a second key with the same fingerprint, or to find a key with a particular fingerprint. So some utilities, such as the Pageant key list box (see <a href="pageant-mainwin-keylist.html#S9.2.1">section 9.2.1</a>) and the Unix <code>ssh-add</code> utility, will list key fingerprints rather than the whole public key.
</p>
<p>
By default, PuTTYgen will display fingerprints in the &#8216;SHA256&#8217; format. If you need to see the fingerprint in the older &#8216;MD5&#8217; format (which looks like <code>aa:bb:cc:...</code>), you can choose &#8216;Show fingerprint as MD5&#8217; from the &#8216;Key&#8217; menu, but bear in mind that this is less cryptographically secure; it may be feasible for an attacker to create a key with the same fingerprint as yours.
