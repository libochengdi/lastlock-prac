<h1><a name="S8.2.3"></a>8.2.3 Selecting the size (strength) of the key</h1>
<p>
The &#8216;Number of bits&#8217; input box allows you to choose the strength of the key PuTTYgen will generate.

<ul><li>
For RSA and DSA, 2048 bits should currently be sufficient for most purposes.
</li>
<li>
For ECDSA, only 256, 384, and 521 bits are supported. (ECDSA offers equivalent security to RSA with smaller key sizes.)
</li>
<li>
For EdDSA, the only valid sizes are 255 bits (these keys are also known as &#8216;<a name="i0"></a>Ed25519&#8217; and are commonly used) and 448 bits (&#8216;<a name="i1"></a>Ed448&#8217;, which is much less common at the time of writing). (256 is also accepted for backward compatibility, but the effect is the same as 255.)
