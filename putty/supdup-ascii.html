<p>
This declares what kind of character set extension your terminal supports. If the server supports it, it will send text using that character set. &#8216;None&#8217; means the standard 95 printable ASCII characters. &#8216;ITS&#8217; means ASCII extended with printable characters in the control character range. This character set is documented in the SUPDUP protocol definition. &#8216;WAITS&#8217; is similar to &#8216;ITS&#8217; but uses some alternative characters in the extended set: most prominently, it will display arrows instead of <code>^</code> and <code>_</code>, and <code>}</code> instead of <code>~</code>. &#8216;ITS&#8217; extended ASCII is used by ITS and Lisp machines, whilst &#8216;WAITS&#8217; is only used by the WAITS operating system from the Stanford AI Laboratory.
