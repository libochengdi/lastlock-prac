<h1><a name="SE.3"></a>E.3 Multiple sessions per process on some platforms</h1>
<p>
Some ports of PuTTY - notably the in-progress Mac port - are constrained by the operating system to run as a single process potentially managing multiple sessions.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the platform-independent parts of PuTTY never use global variables to store per-session data. The global variables that do exist are tolerated because they are not specific to a particular login session. The random number state in <code>sshrand.c</code>, the timer list in <code>timing.c</code> and the queue of top-level callbacks in <code>callback.c</code> serve all sessions equally. But most data is specific to a particular network session, and is therefore stored in dynamically allocated data structures, and pointers to these structures are passed around between functions.
</p>
<p>
Platform-specific code can reverse this decision if it likes. The Windows code, for historical reasons, stores most of its data as global variables. That's OK, because <em>on Windows</em> we know there is only one session per PuTTY process, so it's safe to do that. But changes to the platform-independent code should avoid introducing global variables, unless they are genuinely cross-session.
