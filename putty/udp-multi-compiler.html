<h1><a name="SE.6"></a>E.6 Independence of specific compiler</h1>
<p>
Windows PuTTY can currently be compiled with any of three Windows compilers: MS Visual C, the Cygwin / <code>mingw32</code> GNU tools, and <code>clang</code> (in MS compatibility mode).
</p>
<p>
This is a really useful property of PuTTY, because it means people who want to contribute to the coding don't depend on having a specific compiler; so they don't have to fork out money for MSVC if they don't already have it, but on the other hand if they <em>do</em> have it they also don't have to spend effort installing <code>gcc</code> alongside it. They can use whichever compiler they happen to have available, or install whichever is cheapest and easiest if they don't have one.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we don't want PuTTY to start depending on which compiler you're using. Using GNU extensions to the C language, for example, would ruin this useful property (not that anyone's ever tried it!); and more realistically, depending on an MS-specific library function supplied by the MSVC C library (<code>_snprintf</code>, for example) is a mistake, because that function won't be available under the other compilers. Any function supplied in an official Windows DLL as part of the Windows API is fine, and anything defined in the C library standard is also fine, because those should be available irrespective of compilation environment. But things in between, available as non-standard library and language extensions in only one compiler, are disallowed.
</p>
<p>
(<code>_snprintf</code> in particular should be unnecessary, since we provide <code>dupprintf</code>; see <a href="udp-security.html#SE.5">section E.5</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Compiler independence should apply on all platforms, of course, not just on Windows.
