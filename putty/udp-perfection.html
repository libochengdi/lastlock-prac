<h1><a name="SE.13"></a>E.13 Do as we say, not as we do</h1>
<p>
The current PuTTY code probably does not conform strictly to <em>all</em> of the principles listed above. There may be the occasional SSH-specific piece of code in what should be a backend-independent module, or the occasional dependence on a non-standard X library function under Unix.
</p>
<p>
This should not be taken as a licence to go ahead and violate the rules. Where we violate them ourselves, we're not happy about it, and we would welcome patches that fix any existing problems. Please try to help us make our code better, not worse!
