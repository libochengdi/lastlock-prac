<h1><a name="SE.1"></a>E.1 Cross-OS portability</h1>
<p>
Despite Windows being its main area of fame, PuTTY is no longer a Windows-only application suite. It has a working Unix port; a Mac port is in progress; more ports may or may not happen at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, embedding Windows-specific code in core modules such as <code>ssh.c</code> is not acceptable. We went to great lengths to <em>remove</em> all the Windows-specific stuff from our core modules, and to shift it out into Windows-specific modules. Adding large amounts of Windows-specific stuff in parts of the code that should be portable is almost guaranteed to make us reject a contribution.
</p>
<p>
The PuTTY source base is divided into platform-specific modules and platform-generic modules. The Unix-specific modules are all in the <code>unix</code> subdirectory; the Windows-specific modules are in the <code>windows</code> subdirectory.
</p>
<p>
All the modules in the main source directory and other subdirectories - notably <em>all</em> of the code for the various back ends - are platform-generic. We want to keep them that way.
</p>
<p>
This also means you should stick to the C semantics guaranteed by the C standard: try not to make assumptions about the precise size of basic types such as <code>int</code> and <code>long int</code>; don't use pointer casts to do endianness-dependent operations, and so on.
</p>
<p>
(Even <em>within</em> a platform front end you should still be careful of some of these portability issues. The Windows front end compiles on both 32- and 64-bit x86 and also Arm.)
</p>
<p>
Our current choice of C standards version is <em>mostly</em> C99. With a couple of exceptions, you can assume that C99 features are available (in particular <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> and <code>inline</code>), but you shouldn't use things that are new in C11 (such as <code>&lt;uchar.h&gt;</code> or <code>_Generic</code>).
</p>
<p>
The exceptions to that rule are due to the need for Visual Studio compatibility:
</p>
<ul><li>
Don't use variable-length arrays. Visual Studio doesn't support them even now that it's adopted the rest of C99. We use <code>-Wvla</code> when building with gcc and clang, to make it easier to avoid accidentally breaking that rule.
</li>
<li>
For historical reasons, we still build with one older VS version which lacks <code>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code>. So that file is included centrally in <code>defs.h</code>, and has a set of workaround definitions for the <code>PRIx64</code>-type macros we use. If you need to use another one of those macros, you need to add a workaround definition in <code>defs.h</code>, and don't casually re-include <code>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code> anywhere else in the source file.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here are a few portability assumptions that we <em>do</em> currently allow (because we'd already have to thoroughly vet the existing code if they ever needed to change, and it doesn't seem worth doing that unless we really have to):
</p>
<ul><li>
You can assume <code>int</code> is <em>at least</em> 32 bits wide. (We've never tried to port PuTTY to a platform with 16-bit <code>int</code>, and it doesn't look likely to be necessary in future.)
</li>
<li>
Similarly, you can assume <code>char</code> is exactly 8 bits. (Exceptions to that are even less likely to be relevant to us than short <code>int</code>.)
</li>
<li>
You can assume that using <code>memset</code> to write zero bytes over a whole structure will have the effect of setting all its pointer fields to <code>NULL</code>. (The standard itself guarantees this for <em>integer</em> fields, but not for pointers.)
</li>
<li>
You can assume that <code>time_t</code> has POSIX semantics, i.e. that it represents an integer number of non-leap seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. (Times in this format are used in X authorisation, but we could work around that by carefully distinguishing local <code>time_t</code> from time values used in the wire protocol; but these semantics of <code>time_t</code> are also baked into the shared library API used by the GSSAPI authentication code, which would be much harder to change.)
</li>
<li>
You can assume that the execution character encoding is a superset of the printable characters of ASCII. (In particular, it's fine to do arithmetic on a <code>char</code> value representing a Latin alphabetic character, without bothering to allow for EBCDIC or other non-consecutive encodings of the alphabet.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
On the other hand, here are some particular things <em>not</em> to assume:
</p>
<ul><li>
Don't assume anything about the <em>signedness</em> of <code>char</code>. In particular, you <em>must</em> cast <code>char</code> values to <code>unsigned char</code> before passing them to any <code>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</code> function (because those expect a non-negative character value, or <code>EOF</code>). If you need a particular signedness, explicitly specify <code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code>, or use C99 <code>int8_t</code> or <code>uint8_t</code>.
</li>
<li>
From past experience with MacOS, we're still a bit nervous about <code>'\n'</code> and <code>'\r'</code> potentially having unusual meanings on a given platform. So it's fine to say <code>\n</code> in a string you're passing to <code>printf</code>, but in any context where those characters appear in a standardised wire protocol or a binary file format, they should be spelled <code>'\012'</code> and <code>'\015'</code> respectively.
</li>
</ul>
