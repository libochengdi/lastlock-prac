<h1><a name="S3.11.3.6"></a>3.11.3.6 <a name="i0"></a><code>-m</code>: <a name="i1"></a>read a remote command or script from a file</h1>
<p>
The <a name="i2"></a><code>-m</code> option performs a similar function to the &#8216;<a name="i3"></a>Remote command&#8217; box in the SSH panel of the PuTTY configuration box (see <a href="config-command.html#S4.17.1">section 4.17.1</a>). However, the <code>-m</code> option expects to be given a local file name, and it will read a command from that file.
</p>
<p>
With some servers (particularly Unix systems), you can even put multiple lines in this file and execute more than one command in sequence, or a whole shell script; but this is arguably an abuse, and cannot be expected to work on all servers. In particular, it is known <em>not</em> to work with certain &#8216;embedded&#8217; servers, such as <a name="i4"></a>Cisco routers.

<p>
This option is not available in the file transfer tools PSCP and PSFTP.
