<p>
If you choose &#8216;Event Log&#8217; from the system menu, a small window will pop up in which PuTTY logs significant events during the connection. Most of the events in the log will probably take place during session startup, but a few can occur at any point in the session, and one or two occur right at the end.
</p>
<p>
You can use the mouse to select one or more lines of the Event Log, and hit the Copy button to copy them to the <a name="i1"></a>clipboard. If you are reporting a bug, it's often useful to paste the contents of the Event Log into your bug report.
</p>
<p>
(The Event Log is not the same as the facility to create a log file of your session; that's described in <a href="using-logging.html#S3.2">section 3.2</a>.)
