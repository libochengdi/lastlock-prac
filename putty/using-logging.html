<p>
For some purposes you may find you want to log everything that appears on your screen. You can do this using the &#8216;Logging&#8217; panel in the configuration box.
</p>
<p>
To begin a session log, select &#8216;Change Settings&#8217; from the system menu and go to the Logging panel. Enter a log file name, and select a logging mode. (You can log all session output including the terminal <a name="i2"></a>control sequences, or you can just log the printable text. It depends what you want the log for.) Click &#8216;Apply&#8217; and your log will be started. Later on, you can go back to the Logging panel and select &#8216;Logging turned off completely&#8217; to stop logging; then PuTTY will close the log file and you can safely read it.

See <a href="config-logging.html#S4.2">section 4.2</a> for more details and options.
