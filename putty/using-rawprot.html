<h1><a name="S3.7"></a>3.7 Making <a name="i0"></a>raw TCP connections</h1>
<p>
A lot of <a name="i1"></a>Internet protocols are composed of commands and responses in plain text. For example, <a name="i2"></a>SMTP (the protocol used to transfer e-mail), <a name="i3"></a>NNTP (the protocol used to transfer Usenet news), and <a name="i4"></a>HTTP (the protocol used to serve Web pages) all consist of commands in readable plain text.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it can be useful to connect directly to one of these services and speak the protocol &#8216;by hand&#8217;, by typing protocol commands and watching the responses. On Unix machines, you can do this using the system's <code>telnet</code> command to connect to the right port number. For example, <code>telnet mailserver.example.com 25</code> might enable you to talk directly to the SMTP service running on a mail server.
</p>
<p>
Although the Unix <code>telnet</code> program provides this functionality, the protocol being used is not really Telnet. Really there is no actual protocol at all; the bytes sent down the connection are exactly the ones you type, and the bytes shown on the screen are exactly the ones sent by the server. Unix <code>telnet</code> will attempt to detect or guess whether the service it is talking to is a real Telnet service or not; PuTTY prefers to be told for certain.
</p>
<p>
In order to make a debugging connection to a service of this type, you simply select the fourth protocol name, <a name="i5"></a>&#8216;Raw&#8217;, from the &#8216;Protocol&#8217; buttons in the &#8216;Session&#8217; configuration panel. (See <a href="config-hostname.html#S4.1.1">section 4.1.1</a>.) You can then enter a host name and a port number, and make the connection.
