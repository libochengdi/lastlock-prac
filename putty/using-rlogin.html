<h1><a name="S3.9"></a>3.9 Connecting using the <a name="i0"></a>Rlogin protocol</h1>
<p>
PuTTY can use the Rlogin protocol to connect to a server.
</p>
<p>
Rlogin was similar to Telnet in concept, but more focused on connections between Unix machines. It supported a feature for passwordless login, based on use of &#8216;privileged ports&#8217; (ports with numbers below 1024, which Unix traditionally does not allow users other than <code>root</code> to allocate). Ultimately, based on the server trusting that the client's IP address was owned by the Unix machine it claimed to be, and that that machine would guard its privileged ports appropriately.
</p>
<p>
Like Telnet, Rlogin runs over an unsecured network connection.
