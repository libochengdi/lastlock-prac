<h1><a name="S3.3"></a>3.3 Altering your <a name="i0"></a>character set configuration</h1>
<p>
If you find that special characters (<a name="i1"></a>accented characters, for example, or <a name="i2"></a>line-drawing characters) are not being displayed correctly in your PuTTY session, it may be that PuTTY is interpreting the characters sent by the server according to the wrong <em>character set</em>. There are a lot of different character sets available, and no good way for PuTTY to know which to use, so it's entirely possible for this to happen.

If you click &#8216;Change Settings&#8217; and look at the &#8216;Translation&#8217; panel, you should see a large number of character sets which you can select, and other related options. Now all you need is to find out which of them you want! (See <a href="config-translation.html#S4.10">section 4.10</a> for more information.)
